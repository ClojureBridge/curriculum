Getting Set Up
==============

## Requirements

Everyone in the workshop should have a laptop. If it is running Windows, it should be running Windows 7 or above. If it is running OS X, it should be running 10.7 "Lion" or above. If it is running Linux, you are probably fine.

If anyone attending does not have access to a laptop running one of the above choices, let the instructors know. You can either pair with someone else, or we can provide a virtual machine that you can run if you have a laptop.

## What we are installing

By the end of these instructions, you will have the following installed:

* Java, a "virtual machine" that Clojure runs atop of
* Leiningen, a tool for running Clojure programs
* Nightcode, an editor for Clojure and other programming languages
* Git, a program for managing your program's code

## Instructions by operating system
