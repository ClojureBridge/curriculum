Getting Set Up
==============

## Requirements

Everyone in the workshop should have a laptop. If it is running Windows, it should be running Windows 7 or above. If it is running OS X, it should be running 10.7 "Lion" or above. If it is running Linux, you are probably fine.

If anyone attending does not have access to a laptop running one of the above choices, let the instructors know. You can either pair with someone else, or we can provide a virtual machine that you can run if you have a laptop.

## What we are installing

By the end of these instructions, you will have the following installed:

* **Java standard edition (SE)** - Clojure runs on top of Java.  The Java Runtime Enviromment (JRE) is needed to run Clojure. 
* **Leiningen** - a tool for running Clojure programs, also creating & managing Clojure projects
* **LightTable** - an easy to use development tool for Clojure and other programming languages
* **Git** - versioning your Clojure code (so you can go back to earlier versions if you make a mistake)
