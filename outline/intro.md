## Why Clojure?
{: .slide_title .slide}

####  <button class="link" ng-model="block11" ng-click="block11=!block11">Intro</button>

> If you've never programmed before, you may not know that there are
> many languages to choose from. Some of the other languages you might
> have heard of (or will hear of!) are C, JavaScript, Python, and
> Java.
{: ng-show="block11" .description}

> So why are we teaching Clojure? Although it's not as popular as any
> of those languages, we're using Clojure because of three qualities
> it has that make it an ideal first language to learn--or a great
> language to learn in addition to others you might already know:
{: ng-show="block11" .description}

#### Clojure is _simple_ <button class="link" ng-model="block12" ng-click="block12=!block12">Details</button>

> Clojure is _simple_. That's not to say it's not powerful; it is. The
> number of concepts you have to know to program in Clojure is very
> small, however, and easy to grasp. Clojure grows with you as you
> learn it, and you can be very productive with a small subset of the
> language.
{: ng-show="block12" .description}

#### Clojure is _all-purpose_ <button class="link" ng-model="block13" ng-click="block13=!block13">Details</button>

> Clojure is _all-purpose_. Some languages have a specific focus.
> JavaScript, for example, was traditionally used only in web pages
> (although that's changed somewhat). Objective-C is used mainly for
> iPhone apps. We're going to make a drawing application today, but
> you can use Clojure for any sort of application easily.
{: ng-show="block13" .description}

#### Clojure is _fun_ <button class="link" ng-model="block14" ng-click="block14=!block14">Details</button>

> Clojure is _fun_. That's a matter of opinion, of course, but we
> think it holds true. I hope that during this course you experience
> the joy of seeing a Clojure program come together and do something
> powerful and surprising.
{: ng-show="block14" .description}

<section>
## What is Clojure good at?
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block21" ng-click="block21=!block21">Intro</button>

> So, we said Clojure is all-purpose, and it is. That doesn't mean it
> doesn't have strong suits, though.
{: ng-show="block21" .description}

#### Data processing <button class="link" ng-model="block22" ng-click="block22=!block22">Details</button>

> Clojure is known for being good at data processing. That's because
> it has a good set of data structures--that is, it has several
> built-in ways to represent data that are easy to use and powerful.
{: ng-show="block22" .description}

#### Concurrency <button class="link" ng-model="block23" ng-click="block23=!block23">Details</button>

> Clojure is known for its concurrency. Think about writing
> instructions for four of your friends about how to assemble a
> treehouse, but instead of writing them so one step is done at a
> time, each of your friends does part of the job. Then, they
> coordinate at the right time to assemble those parts into bigger
> parts, and they do this over and over again until the end, when it
> all comes together. Those instructions would be really complicated
> and hard to write--and probably hard to read, too. Clojure gives us
> some easy ways to write these sorts of instructions for computers.
{: ng-show="block23" .description}

#### Everything! <button class="link" ng-model="block24" ng-click="block24=!block24">Details</button>

> Clojure also works well for building drawing applications with
> [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil), which is what we're going to
> do together.

<section>
## What does Clojure look like?
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### Example

```clojure
(+ 3 4)
(max 8 17 2)
(eat "sandwich")
```

#### Parentheses <button class="link" ng-model="block31" ng-click="block31=!block31">Details</button>

> The first thing you notice are parentheses, probably. Parentheses
> enclose instructions to the computer in Clojure. Every time you see
> a left parenthesis, the next thing you see will be an instruction of
> some sort. That instruction is normally what we call a _function_.
> Functions do all the hard work in Clojure. They take in
> _arguments_--which are everything else inside the parentheses after
> the function--and return a new value.
{: ng-show="block31" .description}

#### Plus sign <button class="link" ng-model="block32" ng-click="block32=!block32">Details</button>

> Take a look at the first line. The plus sign that you see is a
> function. It takes all its arguments and adds them together,
> returning the sum. This might look confusing if you try to think of
> it like writing out math, because you'd put the plus sign in a
> different place that way. Just think of the plus as a function. If
> you've used Excel, imagine the `SUM()` function in there; it works
> like that.
{: ng-show="block32" .description}

#### Functions <button class="link" ng-model="block33" ng-click="block33=!block33">Details</button>

> What is the function on the next line? What are its arguments? What
> do you think it returns? It returns the number 17, which is the
> largest of the three numbers.
{: ng-show="block33" .description}

> How about the last line? That has a thing called a string in it,
> which we'll learn more about later. Looks like someone is hungry.
{: ng-show="block33" .description}

### Comments

<button class="link" ng-model="block41" ng-click="block41=!block41">Details 1</button>
<button class="link" ng-model="block42" ng-click="block42=!block42">Details 2</button>

> When we write code, we try to make it as clear as possible. Doing so
> is a huge advantage because our code gets read by others (oftentimes
> more so than by us!), or we come back to our own code to read it
> later, by which point we may have forgotten each exact detail of the
> code. One way that we can clarify our code is annotating it with
> comments. Comments are notes that we add to code, for our own sake,
> that the computer ignores.
{: ng-show="block41" .description}

> In Clojure, comments can be started with a semicolon. Everything
> after a semicolon until the end of that line is a comment that gets
> ignored by the computer. Only one semicolon is necessary, but
> sometimes you see two semicolons in a row, depending on stylistic
> tastes.
{: ng-show="block42" .description}

```clojure
;; more food code
(eat "cookie") ; nom nom nom
(eat "donut") ; mmm donuts
```

<section>
## What is a REPL?
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block51" ng-click="block51=!block51">Intro</button>

> "REPL" stands for "Read-Eval-Print-Loop," which still doesn't make a
> ton of sense without context. Many programming languages, including
> Clojure, have a way to execute code interactively so you get instant
> feedback. In other words, the code is read, then it is evaluated,
> then the result is printed, and you begin again--thus, a loop.
{: ng-show="block51" .description}

## REPL in action
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### Light Table's "insta-REPL" <button class="link" ng-model="block61" ng-click="block61=!block61">Details</button>

> Clojure has a REPL that you can run from the terminal easily, and
> we'll talk more about that later, but for now, let's use Light
> Table's "insta-REPL," a nice way to interact with Clojure from
> within Light Table.
{: ng-show="block61" .description}


#### Start REPL <button class="link" ng-model="block62" ng-click="block62=!block62">Details</button>

> Go ahead and start Light Table, if you haven't already. Once it's
> started, go to the "View" menu and click "Commands." Notice that you
> can get to the command by typing ctrl+space from now on, if that's
> faster for you. Type "insta" and press enter when the "Instarepl:
> Open a Clojure instarepl" choice is highlighted.
{: ng-show="block62" .description}

> After you hit enter, a blank new page will open. At the bottom of
> Light Table, you should see a message about "connecting" or
> "retrieving deps." Wait for the instarepl to finish connecting
> before typing anything.
{: ng-show="block62" .description}

#### Try it out <button class="link" ng-model="block63" ng-click="block63=!block63">Details</button>

> Once that's done, let's try out the REPL together! Type `(+ 2 3)`
> and see what happens. Did you see the result appearing beside what
> you were typing? Once you've done that, hit enter and type `(max 8
> 17 2)`. You might see an error in red while typing. This happens
> because Light Table is continually evaluating what you are typing,
> and before you finish, the code might not be valid.
{: ng-show="block63" .description}
</section>

<section>
## Simple values

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block71" ng-click="block71=!block71">Intro</button>

> In order to do anything in a programming language, you need to have
> values to do stuff with. In Clojure, simple values are numbers,
> strings, booleans, and keywords.
{: ng-show="block71" .description}
</section>

<section>
### Numbers

#### Integers <button class="link" ng-model="block81" ng-click="block81=!block81">Details</button>

> Clojure has several different types of numbers.
{: ng-show="block81" .description}

> First up are integers. Integers include zero, the positive whole
> numbers, and the negative whole numbers, and you write them just
> like we write them normally.
{: ng-show="block81" .description}

```clojure
0
12
-42
```
</section>

<section>
#### Decimal numbers <button class="link" ng-model="block91" ng-click="block91=!block91">Details</button>

> Then we have decimal numbers, which are also called floats. They
> include any numbers that have a decimal point in them.
{: ng-show="block91" .description}

```clojure
0.0000072725
10.5
-99.9
```
</section>

<section>
#### Ratios <button class="link" ng-model="block101" ng-click="block101=!block101">Details</button>

> Finally, we have fractions, which are also called ratios. Computers
> cannot perfectly represent all floats, but ratios are always exact.
> We write them with a slash, like so:
{: ng-show="block101" .description}

> Note that, just like with pen-and-paper math, the [denominator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraction_%28mathematics%29) of your ratio cannot be equal to `0`.
{: ng-show="block101" .description}

```clojure
1/2
-7/3
```
</section>

<section>
### Arithmetic
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block111" ng-click="block111=!block111">Intro</button>

> You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. In Clojure,
> arithmetic looks a little different than it does when you write it
> out with pen and paper. Look at these examples:
{: ng-show="block111" .description}

```clojure
(+ 1 1)  ;=> 1 + 1 = 2
(- 12 4) ;=> 12 - 4 = 8
(* 13 2) ;=> 13 * 2 = 26
(/ 27 9) ;=> 27 / 9 = 3
```
</section>

<section>
### Infix vs. prefix notation
{: .slide-title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block121" ng-click="block121=!block121">Details</button>

> In Clojure, `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` appear before two numbers. This is
> called _prefix notation_. What you're used to seeing is called
> _infix notation_, as the arithmetic operator is in-between the two
> operands.
{: ng-show="block121" .description}

> Prefix notation is useful for many reasons. Look at this example of
> an infix expression and the prefix equivalent:
{: ng-show="block121" .description}

```clojure
Infix:  1 + 2 * 3 / 4 + 5 - 6 * 7 / 8 + 9

Prefix: (+ (- (+ (+ 1 (/ (* 2 3) 4)) 5) (/ (* 6 7) 8)) 9)
```
</section>

<section>
### Why prefix is better?

#### Explicit precedence <button class="link" ng-model="block131" ng-click="block131=!block131">Details</button>

> I imagine both are unclear, but notice that in the prefix version,
> you do not have to ever think about the precedence of operators.
> Because each expression has the operator before all the operands and
> the entire expression is wrapped in parentheses, all precendence is
> explicit.
{: ng-show="block131" .description}

```clojure
Infix:  1 + 2 / 3
Prefix: (+ 1 (/ 2 3))
```

#### Less repetitive <button class="link" ng-model="block132" ng-click="block132=!block132">Details</button>

> Another reason prefix notation can be nice is that it can make long
> expressions less repetitive.
> With prefix notation, if we plan to use the same operator on many
> operands, we do not have to repeat the operator between them.
{: ng-show="block132" .description}

```clojure
Infix:  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9
Prefix: (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
```
</section>

<section>
### Arithmetic with all number types

<button class="link" ng-model="block141" ng-click="block141=!block141">Details</button>

> I used integers with all of the above, but we can use floats or
> ratios just fine, as well. See these examples:
{: ng-show="block141" .description}

```clojure
(+ 4/3 7/8)   ;=> 53/24
(- 9 4.2 1/2) ;=> 4.3
(/ 27/2 1.5)  ;=> 9.0
```
</section>

<section>
### Other simple value types

<button class="link" ng-model="block151" ng-click="block151=!block151">Details</button>

> Although we will look at these in more depth later, here are some
> examples of other types of simple values so that you may recognize
> them along the way in any code that you see. The following are
> examples of strings, keywords, and booleans:
{: ng-show="block151" .description}

```clojure
;; strings
"Salut tout le monde"
"Prost!"

;; keywords
:surname
:birth-date
:r2

;; booleans
true
false
```
</section>

<section>
## Assigning names to values

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block161" ng-click="block161=!block161">Intro</button>

> If we had to type the same values over and over, it would be very
> hard to write a program. What we need are names for values, so we
> can refer to them in a way we can remember. We do that using `def`.
{: ng-show="block161" .description}
</section>

<section>
### `def`

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block171" ng-click="block171=!block171">Details</button>

> Type the following into your instarepl.
> When you assign a name to a value, that name is called a _symbol_.
{: ng-show="block171" .description}

```clojure
(def mangoes 3)
(def oranges 5)
(+ mangoes oranges)
;=> 8
```
</section>

<section>
#### Assign results to symbols <button class="link" ng-model="block181" ng-click="block181=!block181">Details</button>

> You can assign more than simple values to symbols. Try the following.
> Look at the last line, and see how we can use symbols by themselves to refer to a value.
{: ng-show="block181" .description}

```clojure
(def fruit (+ mangoes oranges))
(def average-fruit-amount (/ fruit 2))
average-fruit-amount
;=> 4
```
</section>

<section>
### EXERCISE: Basic arithmetic

* Take your height in feet and inches and convert it to inches using arithmetic in Clojure.
* Then convert that to centimeters. There are 2.54 centimeters in an inch.
* Lastly, ask two people near you for their height in centimeters. Find the average of your heights.
</section>

<section>
### BONUS: Convert back to feet and inches

* Convert that average back to feet and inches.
* The feet and the inches will be separate numbers.
* `(quot x y)` will give you the whole number part when dividing two
numbers.
* `(mod x y)` will give you the remainder when dividing two numbers.
