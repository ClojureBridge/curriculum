### What is flow control?
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### Decisions how to react <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block11" ng-click="block11=!block11"></button>

> "Flow control" is the programming term for deciding how to react to
> a given circumstance. We make decisions like this all the time. *If*
> it's a nice day out, *then* we should visit the park; *otherwise* we
> should stay inside and play board games. *If* your car's tank is
> empty, *then* you should visit a gas station; *otherwise* you should
> continue to your destination.
{: ng-show="block11" .description}

#### Testing conditions to react <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block12" ng-click="block12=!block12"></button>

> Software is also full of these decisions. *If* the user's input is
> valid, *then* we should save her data; *otherwise* we show an error
> message. The common pattern here is that you test some condition and
> react differently based on whether the condition is *true* or *false*.

### `if`
{: .slide_title .slide}

<button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block21" ng-click="block21=!block21"></button>

> In Clojure, the most basic tool we have for the flow control is the `if`
> operator. It allows you to choose between two options depending upon a condition.

```clojure
(if (= 1 x)
  "x is one!"
  "x is not one!")
```

(if conditional-expression
  expression-to-evaluate-when-true

### Checking for valid data
{: .slide_title .slide}

<button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block31" ng-click="block31=!block31"></button>

> Here' an example of how you might code the data validation scenario using `if`.
> If adding 40 to `y` is still less than 150, then return `(+ y 40)`; otherwise,
> returns -150. (As for turtle app's frame, the top has 150 in y, while the bottom has -150 in y.)
{: ng-show="block31" .description}

```clojure
(if (< (+ y 40) 150)  ; would the moved y still be below 150 (the top)?
  (+ y 40)            ; if so, then move y
  -150))              ; if not, then set y to -150 (the bottom)
```

#### Truthiness <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block51" ng-click="block51=!block51"></button>

> When testing the truth of an expression, Clojure considers the
> values `nil` and `false` to be false and everything else to be true.
> Here are some examples:
{: ng-show="block51" .description}

> Reference: [Truthiness](http://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/clojure/truthiness/)
{: ng-show="block51" .description}


```clojure
(if "anything other than nil or false is considered true"
  "A string is considered true"
  "A string is not considered true")
;=> "A string is considered true"

(if nil
  "nil is considered true"
  "nil is not considered true")
;=> "nil is not considered true"

(if (get {:a 1} :b)
  "expressions which evaluate to nil are considered true"
  "expressions which evaluate to nil are not considered true")
;=> "expressions which evaluate to nil are not considered true"
```

#### EXERCISE 1: Y value within a frame
{: .slide_title .slide}

* Write a function `y-within-frame` that takes y (vertical position) as an argument.
* You may use if example in the slide.
* The function should return the y value that won't exceed 150.

    - See: [x and y in absolute values](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge/blob/master/outline/TURTLE.md#x-and-y-in-absolute-values)

```clojure
;; if example
(if (< (+ y 40) 150)
  (+ y 40)
  -150))
```

```clojure
;; usage of y-within-frame function
(y-within-frame 80)    ;=> 120
(y-within-frame 180)   ;=> -150
```

### `cond`
{: .slide_title .slide}

<button class="link" ng-bind-html="details1" ng-model="block61" ng-click="block61=!block61"></button>
<button class="link" ng-bind-html="details2" ng-model="block62" ng-click="block62=!block62"></button>

> The `if` operator takes only one predicate.
> When we want to use multiple predicates, `if` is not a good option.
> We have to write nested, nested, ... and nested `if` conditions.
> To branch to multiple situations, `cond` operator works well.
{: ng-show="block61" .description}

> Here's the example. If adding 40 to y exceeds 150, evaluate the
> first form. In this case, it returns -150. If adding 40 to y is less
> than -150, evaluate the second form. In this case, it returns 150.
> If both two predicates return false, evaluate the `:else` form. In
> this case, it returns y plus 40. If we use this function in the
> turtle app, we can keep our turtle between top and bottom of the frame.
{: ng-show="block62" .description}

> Reference: [Conditional `cond`](http://clojurebridge.github.io/community-docs/docs/clojure/cond/)
{: ng-show="block62" .description}

```clojure
(cond
  (> (+ y 40) 150) -150
  (< (+ y 40) -150) 150
  :else (+ y 40)))
```

<section ng-controller="NarrativeController">
#### General form of `cond` operator

```clojure
(cond
  predicate1 expression-to-evaluate-when-predicate1-is-true
  predicate2 expression-to-evaluate-when-predicate2-is-true
  ...
  :else expression-to-evaluate-when-all-above-are-false)
```
</section>

<section>
#### EXERCISE 2: Y value within a frame - part 2
{: .slide_title .slide}

> The function we wrote in the previous exercise, `y-within-frame`, has
> a flaw. If the given y value is -1000, the function will return -960.
> Since y value of the frame bottom is -150, -960 is beyond that.
> Your turtle will go invisible area. Let's make it real within-frame
> function using `cond`.

* Write a function `y-within-frame-cond` that takes y (vertical position) as an argument.
* You may use `cond` example in the slide.
* The function should return the y value between -150 and 150.

    - See: [x and y in absolute values](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge/blob/master/outline/TURTLE.md#x-and-y-in-absolute-values)

```clojure
;; usage of y-within-frame-cond function
(y-within-frame-cond 200)    ;=> -150
(y-within-frame-cond -200)   ;=> 150
(y-within-frame-cond 0)      ;=> 40
```

#### EXERCISE 3 [BONUS]: Shoe Size Mapping
{: .slide_title .slide}

|Suppose you are traveling abroad..<br/> (chart: www.jcpenney.com )| ![shoe size](img/shoe_size_chart_womens.png)|

1. pick up some of sets from the table, for example, us 6 and 9
2. write mapping using `cond` (us 6 -> less than or equal to euro 36)
3. write a function, for example, `us-to-euro` with one argument
4. use `cond` you wrote at step 2 to complete the function

### Boolean logic with `and`, `or`, and `not`
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block81" ng-click="block81=!block81">Intro</button>

> `if` statements are not limited to testing only one thing. You can
> test multiple conditions using boolean logic. _Boolean logic_ refers

{: ng-show="block81" .description}

> If you've never seen this concept in programming before, remember

(defn leap-year?
  "Every four years, except years divisible by 100, but yes for years divisible by 400."
