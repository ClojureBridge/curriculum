ClojureBridge Teacher's Guide 
=============================

There are many ways to teach the ClojureBridge material, and none of them are \"right.\" The following is a guide to working though the curriculum with students based on the experience of some workshop organizers and teachers.

There are three pieces to the curriculum: the curriculum [narrative](README.md), the [slides](http://clojurebridge.github.io/curriculum), and the capstone app [pt. 1](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/drawing/blob/master/curriculum/first-program.md) and [pt. 2](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/drawing/blob/master/curriculum/create-something.md). The slides are supposed to be in sync with the curriculum narrative. The slides are what you show on the projector in front of the room. The narrative is a more detailed explanation of what is introduced in the slides. Students may follow along with the narrative on their own computers or may even use it to work on their own.
