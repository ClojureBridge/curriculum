      "This is a longer string that I wrote for purposes of an example."
      "Aubrey said, \"I think we should go to the Orange Julius.\"

# Booleans and nil

# Keywords

  * Keywords don't have a real world analog like numbers or strings

  Think of keywords as a special kind of string, one used for labels.

    :name
    :input

# Exercise: Store the name of your hometown

Write the name of your hometown as a string and then assign that
string to the name `my-hometown`.

# Exercise: Make a function to format names

The `str` function can take any number of arguments, and it
concatenates them together to make a string.

Write a function called `format-name` that takes two
arguments, `first-name` and `last-name`. This
function should output the name like so: Last, First.
