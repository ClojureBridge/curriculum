# ClojureBridge slides

These slides are written with [Hoplon](http://hoplon.io/), a ClojureScript-to-HTML compiler, using [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) for displaying slides.

In order to build the slides, you need the Clojure build tool [boot](https://github.com/tailrecursion/boot) installed. See Boot's "[Getting Started](https://github.com/tailrecursion/boot)" section for installation instructions.

After installing boot, you can run `boot development` to compile the Hoplon code, watch the code for changes, and show the output on http://localhost:8000/ via Ring. You can run `boot hoplon` to just compile the Hoplon code.
