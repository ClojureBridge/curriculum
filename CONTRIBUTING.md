# How to contribute

Updates to the ClojureBridge curriculum are welcome and encouraged. We would not have anything without the input from the volunteers who put on workshops.

Also feel free to make forks of the curriculum and not contribute back. Make different curricula, too. These contribution guidelines are simply meant to provide guidance for the management of the main ClojureBridge curriculum.


## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes
* (Probably need some stuff in here about keeping slides in sync with narrative, etc)
* Commit changes
* (Add more git guidance?)

## Submitting Changes
* Push your committed changes to your local fork of the repository
* Create a pull request 
* Submit a pull request (PR) to the ClojureBridge/curriculum repository
* The ClojureBridge curriculum team will review and discuss the pull requestin comments on the PR.
* Two curriculum team members must give a thumbs up, then the PR will be accepted.


# Curriculum Team
* Wait, why does the curriculum team get to say which PRs get accepted?? I'm glad you asked! If you contribute more than two patches, you, too, will become part of the curriculum team. 
* Curriculum team members are given commit rights to the curriculum.
* Commit rights are meant for approving PRs, not for making direct commits.
* There is also a [ClojureBridge curriculum group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojurebridge-curriculum) for discussing curriculum direction. 


# Workshop/Chapter curriculum forks
* Workshops or chapters that are using the main ClojureBridge curriculum should fork the curriculum in their chapter's github (a la [https://github.com/clojurebridge-sf/curriculum](https://github.com/clojurebridge-sf/curriculum))
* Give teachers commit rights to the chapter's fork of the curriculum
* The submit pull requests to the main curriculum, if you would like to contribute the changes back.
